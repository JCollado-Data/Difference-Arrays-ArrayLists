# Difference-Arrays-ArrayLists
 Define the techincal differences bewteen Array and Array Lists in Java, while providing coded examples.

## Arrays
Arrays are fixed-sized structures that are used to store elements of the same data type.

### How Arrays work and how to use them.
-Arrays use continous memory allocation which means they indexs will all be located next to each other in memory.
-Arrays are declared using brackets ('[]')
-Initialized using ('**datatype**[] name = new **datatype**[x] )


## Array List
Array Lists are dynamic structures that are resizeable and store elements.

### How Array List work and how to use them.
-Array Lists can use add, remove, and access elements easily
-Array are declared using brackets ('ArrayList<Type>')
-Initialize other methods such as ("'size()','add()','remove()', 'get()' ")
